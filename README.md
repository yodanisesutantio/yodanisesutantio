## 🏰 Ah, another traveler has arrived… Welcome to my GitHub! 

I’m Yodanis, a wannabe full-stack adventurer on a quest to master React ⚛️ and Laravel 🔥. My journey is filled with debugging battles, design dilemmas, and the occasional victory when my code actually runs.

🎮 Character Stats:
    🛠️ Class: Full-Stack Developer (in Training)
    🎨 Special Skill: Making things look good before they actually work
    🔥 Weakness: Fixing one bug only to summon three more
    📖 Current Quest: Learning how to build cool things without breaking them

⚔️ Active Quests:
    ✅ Learning React & Laravel to level up my skills
    ✅ Exploring UI/UX design so my apps don’t look like they were made in 2005
    ✅ Trying to start an actual side project instead of just thinking about it

⚡ Inventory:
    🖥️ Weapons: VS Code, Figma, and of course Youtube
    🛡️ Armor: Coffee ☕, Dark Mode, and the power of AI

If you, too, are on a journey of coding chaos, let’s connect! Whether you’re a fellow developer, designer, or just someone who also battles JavaScript errors daily, let’s learn together. 🚀
